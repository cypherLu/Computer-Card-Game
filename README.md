# Computer-Card-Game
There are a wide range of software that can be used on a computer system and these can be grouped in three main categories:

Operating System: The Operating System (OS) is the foundational software that manages a computerâ€™s hardware and software resources, providing a platform for other software to run (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).

Utility Software: Utility Software includes tools designed to maintain and optimise the performance of the computer, such as antivirus programs, disk defragmentation software, and file management utilities.

Application Software: Application Software consists of programs designed for specific user tasks, like word processors, web browsers, graphic editing software and video games, enabling users to perform activities on the computer.
For this challenge we will consider a deck of cards where each card represents a piece of software. The game will consist of randomly selecting three cards from the deck and revealing them to the player:

Three of a Kind: If all three software are from the same category, the player will score 100 points. This could be when three Operating System cards are revealed, or three utility software or three application software.

Split: If the first card and the third card are from the same category, the player will score 50 points. Note that the card in the middle will need to be from a different category.

Pair: If either the first two cards or the last two cards are from the same category, the player will score 30 points. Note that the remaining card will need to be from a different category.
